Make UI more sensible w/r/t folder and file creation
Update UI for signup/login and link pages together
Icons for folders/files?
Add error handling for 

    * duplicate file name

    * general server errors



DONE:

Cascade renaming down to children folders
    * if you rename 2nd level folder, 4th+ level folders still have old path
Errors:
        * query strings w/ invalid folder name
            * having unique constraint vs. allowing same names (allow same names)
                * duplicate folder name
    * renaming to existing name
